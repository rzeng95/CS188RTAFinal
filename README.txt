The Golden Key is a first-person shooter game created using the Unity Game Engine. I created this game as part of a 10-week long project during CS188. Each week, I iterated upon my project, adding new features as I learned them in class. Character behavior, interactions, and AI are all coded in C# scripts, following the Unity C# API.

To view my C# scripts, see /Assets/My Scripts

If a clone is made of this project, the project file that can be opened up in Unity is found under /Assets/GoldenKey

For a list of assets I used, see "Credits List." All assets used were free, found either online or via the Unity Asset Store, and I have credited the authors and artists accordingly.
